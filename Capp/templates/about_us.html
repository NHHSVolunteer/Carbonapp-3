        <p>
            We are an international team of seven students from Japan, China, Vietnam and Norway.
            Together, we have developed <em>MyEcoFriend</em> — a user-friendly platform that helps you track 
            and better understand your carbon emissions from everyday transportation.
            Our goal is not just to measure emissions, but to make them understandable. 
            By putting your numbers into context and comparing them with national averages, 
            we aim to raise awareness and encourage more climate-conscious decisions. Scroll down to read
